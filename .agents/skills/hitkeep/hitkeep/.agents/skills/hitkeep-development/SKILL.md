# HitKeep Development

Treat `AGENTS.md` as policy and `hk` as workflow truth. Never copy commands, build tags, environment defaults, variants, ports, tool versions, or QA gates into another instruction surface.

## Connect

Use the central local HitKeep developer MCP for every operation it exposes. It is a stateless server-catalog stdio adapter over the same worktree-confined services as the CLI and is separate from the production analytics `/mcp` endpoint. A configured or enabled host entry is not enough; confirm that the relevant callable `hk_*` tools are exposed and make a read-only call before relying on MCP.

Follow this connection order:

1. Inspect the host's callable tools and select the relevant `hk_*` operation instead of translating it into shell.
2. Start with a read-only status or planning call and verify that its workspace ID matches the configured fallback or explicit workspace selector. Pass the optional `workspace` input only when selecting a different catalogued worktree; it accepts a catalogued workspace ID or absolute path.
3. If tools are absent or fail, inspect host MCP health and compare the configured server name, executable, and arguments with `./hk mcp manifest --output json`. Report whether registration, startup, workspace routing, or task reload is blocking MCP. Existing tasks may need a host reload before a corrected registration becomes callable.
4. Obtain explicit user approval before invoking any equivalent structured CLI action. After approval, discover the command and flags through `./hk catalog commands --output json`, request `--output json`, and consume `schema_version`, `status`, `workspace_id`, `data`, and `error`. Stop on an unknown schema version instead of guessing.

Reserve direct `./hk` use for MCP bootstrap or repair, an explicitly approved fallback, and operations intentionally absent from MCP such as formatter or Go migration rewrites. Never guess a workspace or silently edit client-owned global configuration.

Use the typed MCP surface rather than translating an action into shell yourself:

- Read bounded workspace, catalog, configuration, handoff, and runtime/cache views with `hk_context`; diagnose prerequisites with `hk_doctor`.
- Start, inspect with bounded cursor-addressed events, or stop an exact observed development generation with `hk_dev_start`, `hk_dev_status`, and `hk_dev_stop`.
- Capture local visual-QA routes with `hk_screenshot`; batch related routes so they share one browser session, and use returned resource links rather than copying images into the repository.
- Start setup, QA, deterministic builds, and image smokes asynchronously with `hk_run_start`.
- Observe runs and bounded gate logs with `hk_run_status`; cancel one exact observed run with `hk_run_cancel`.

Start operations return accepted or reused state immediately. Poll `hk_dev_status` or `hk_run_status` with the returned cursor or identifier for readiness, bounded progress, and failure logs. Equivalent approved CLI actions use `--detach --output json`.

## Route the Work

- Use `$hitkeep-workspace` for worktree isolation, ports, services, long-running operations, concurrent agents, logs, or handoff.
- Use `$hitkeep-qa` for gate selection, execution, investigation, and completion evidence.
- Use `$hitkeep-i18n` when user-visible dashboard language or localized formatting changes.
- Load only the relevant reference below for implementation guidance. Do not create or load area-specific HitKeep skills alongside this one.

## Implementation References

- Read [backend.md](references/backend.md) for Go runtime, API, auth, MCP, AI, or DuckDB changes.
- Read [frontend.md](references/frontend.md) for Angular, dashboard UX, seed data, browser verification, or screenshots.
- Read [product.md](references/product.md) for product shaping or an end-to-end analytics feature.
- Read [delivery.md](references/delivery.md) for docs, OpenAPI, integrations, release preparation, or infrastructure-adjacent work.

## Workflow

1. Read `AGENTS.md`; inspect workspace status, the development session, and active finite runs before doing setup or starting services.
2. Diagnose prerequisites. Development is container-only. Run setup only when diagnostics or missing container dependencies require it; warm worktrees should reuse images and caches.
3. Read the variant resource/catalog once per task before development, build, or smoke work. Refresh it after pulling or rebuilding `hk`.
4. Start development only when the task needs services. Use the catalog-provided variant and returned URLs; never infer tags, defaults, or ports.
5. Treat development as a workspace session with cursor-addressed events. Treat screenshot capture as a bounded synchronous operation against that active local session. Treat setup, QA, build, and smoke results as finite run handles. Preserve the workspace ID and the appropriate cursor or run ID, and read bounded logs only when progress or failure requires it.
6. Build and smoke through typed actions. Cloud images are local-only; never add or invoke publication behavior.
7. For Go or frontend source, discover formatter scopes and migration modes from the structured command catalog. Checks are non-mutating; rewriting is a deliberate confined CLI action and is not exposed through MCP. Review changed paths before continuing.
8. Finish through `$hitkeep-qa`. Report the profile, stable gate IDs, result, and concrete blockers without copying successful logs.

Never request arbitrary shell execution through MCP, mutate Git, delete worktrees, perform cleanup, publish artifacts, manage credentials, or invoke infrastructure deployment as part of this skill. Do not use the developer MCP for product analytics.
